      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Hey, I’m Aditya Tupe — a passionate developer who loves turning ideas into reality through code, creativity, and consistency.</p>
      <p>I work across front-end, Python, and AI/ML — crafting clean web interfaces,<br> building logic-driven apps, and exploring how machines can learn just like us.</p>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I’m a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, always exploring how tech can solve real problems.
        My journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I learned how to design smooth, responsive websites.
        <br>From there, I picked up Python — diving into automation, data, and basic AI/ML models.
        <br>I believe in learning by building — not just watching tutorials. Every project I make teaches me something new.

        <br>Right now, I’m sharpening my front-end skills with React, experimenting with ML algorithms, and slowly moving toward becoming a full-stack AI developer.</p>

      <h2>Mindset</h2>
      <p>For me, coding isn’t just syntax — it’s creativity in digital form.
        <br>I don’t chase perfection; I chase progress.
        <br>Every line of code, every error fixed, every late-night debug — it’s all part of the grind.
        <br>My mission is to build tech that feels alive, fast, and meaningful.</p>
